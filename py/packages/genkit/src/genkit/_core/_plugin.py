        Naming rule. When an app asks for ``{plugin.name}/{rest}``:

        1. Genkit removes exactly one ``{plugin.name}/`` from the front and
           passes ``rest`` as ``name``. That's the provider's id, verbatim:
           send it upstream unchanged and don't strip anything from it.
           Provider ids may contain slashes (publisher paths, tuned
           endpoints, ARNs, OpenRouter ids).
        2. The returned action is renamed to exactly what the app asked for
